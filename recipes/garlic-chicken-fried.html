        <h2>Garlic Chicken</h2>
        <p>At one point last year, garlic fried chicken went viral within the Indonesian and Malaysian TikTok sphere. It
            was
            everywhere! So after a few of those videos came across my feed, you can say I was influenced. I had to give
            my
            own spin to it.</p>
        <p>After quite a few trials, I've nailed it down. Now it's one of my favorite fried chicken recipes ever! And
            every
            single person that's tried this with me have loved it.</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>2 teaspoons garlic powder, or to taste</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon paprika</li>
            <li>½ cup seasoned bread crumbs</li>
            <li>1 cup all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>½ cup milk</li>
            <li>1 egg</li>
            <li>4 skinless, boneless chicken breast halves - pounded thin</li>
            <li>1 cup oil for frying, or as needed</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Directions</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>In a shallow dish, mix together the garlic powder, pepper, salt, paprika, bread crumbs and flour. In a
                separate dish, whisk together the milk and egg. </li>
            <li>Heat the oil in an electric skillet set to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Dip the chicken into the egg
                and
                milk, then dredge in the dry ingredients until evenly coated. </li>
            <li>Fry chicken in the hot oil for about 5 minutes per side, or until the chicken is cooked through and
                juices
                run clear. Remove from the oil with a slotted spatula, and serve. </li>
        </ol>
